We are very excited to announce the release of RDF4J 4.0!

RDF4J 4.0.0 is a major release of the RDF4J framework, focusing on improved
performance and improved maintainability. We've done a massive clean up of the
project structure, which will make it easier to deliver new features in this
and future releases. In total, we addressed over 100 issues. Highlights
include:

<!--more-->
- Update to Java 11 as the minimally-required version of Java
- An (experimental) new embedded triplestore: the [LMDB store](/documentation/programming/lmdb-store)
- Better support for Spring and Spring Boot (see [documentation](/documentation/programming/spring) for details)
- Massive performance improvements in the SHACL engine and Memory Sail
- Speed and optimization improvements in the SPARQL query engine
- Various improvements in the SparqlBuilder

For more details, including instruction on how to upgrade, see the [release notes](/release-notes/4.0.0).
